# `Mega Games 10` Disassembly
Games developed by Sega, Epyx, and Sonic Team, and menu developed by Sega for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.    
I claim no ownership of the code.

Disassembled using IDA Pro, along with some manual fixing to the disassembled code, as well as a bug fix for Sonic 1's disassembly (by Hivebrain).
